## Site design template

The site was originally built using the Serif theme from Zerostatic themes. Serif provides a modern business theme for Jekyll, as an underlying design and architecture. Significant modification of the underlying structure and design was undertaken in 2024 & 2025. If you want to use the original Serif theme, you can see it at the [Live Demo](https://jekyll-serif.netlify.app/) or learn more at [Zerostatic Themes](https://www.zerostatic.io).
