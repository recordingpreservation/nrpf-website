# NRPF Board and Staff

Our board of directors provides strategy and advice for NRPF activities. 
Board members oversee NRPF programs, shape strategy, and provide governance over NRPF resources. 

Directors are appointed by the Librarian of Congress and represent diverse points of view from the sound recording community. 
Board members are selected for their 
knowledge of philanthropy and grantmaking, as well 
as experience in sound recording production, 
distribution, preservation, or restoration.
