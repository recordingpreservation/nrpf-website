Check out the NRPF podcast, _Sound Files_.
On the pod, we share and celebrate archival audio
through conversations and stories.

Have you ever wondered what it takes to preserve historic sounds and audio collections?

the preservation of recorded sounds, as well as the people and organizations who preserve them.

The podcast:

* Provides "behind-the-scenes" perspectives on the work that goes into archival audio preservation

* Shares and amplifies the work of audio archivists and the collections they steward
