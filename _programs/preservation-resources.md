We connect collection stewards, funders, and policymakers
to up-to-date, useful, and reliable information about
the state of recorded sound preservation, care and handling for  
long-term stewardship of analog audio media, and
planning for the digitization of audio materials.  

As articulated by the [National Recording Preservation Plan]({{ site.data.nrpf_data.nrpp_link }}), "The Foundation should provide guidance to grant-making organizations on technical issues, as well as on legal issues related to the provision of public access to sound recordings preserved by grant funds" (73).
