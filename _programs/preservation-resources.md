We aim to connect collection stewards, funders, and policymakers 
to the most up-to-date, useful, and trustworthy information about 
the state of recorded sound preservation, how to preserve analog audio media and
store collections, and resources to plan for the digitization of audio materials.  

As articulated by the National Recording Preservation Plan, "The Foundation should provide guidance to grant-making organizations on technical issues, as well as on legal issues related to the provision of public access to sound recordings preserved by grant funds" (73).
