We aim to connect collection stewards, funders, and policymakers 
to up-to-date, useful, and reliable information about: 
the state of recorded sound preservation, guidance for the preservation 
and care of analog audio media, and 
resources to plan for the digitization of audio materials.  

As articulated by the National Recording Preservation Plan, "The Foundation should provide guidance to grant-making organizations on technical issues, as well as on legal issues related to the provision of public access to sound recordings preserved by grant funds" (73).

[Illinois Institute of Technology]
<br/><span class="link-note">In 1946, Dr. David P. Boder, a psychology professor from Chicago&#039;s Illinois Institute of Technology, traveled to Europe to record the stories of Holocaust survivors in their own words. Over a period of three months, he visited refugee camps in France, Switzerland, Italy, and Germany, carrying a wire recorder and 200 spools of steel wire, upon which he was able to record over 90 hours of first-hand testimony. These recordings represent the earliest known oral histories of the Holocaust, which are available through this online archive.</span></li>
