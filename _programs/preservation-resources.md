We aim to connect collection stewards, funders, and policymakers 
to up-to-date, useful, and reliable information about: 
the state of recorded sound preservation, guidance for the preservation 
and care of analog audio media, and 
resources to plan for the digitization of audio materials.  

As articulated by the National Recording Preservation Plan, "The Foundation should provide guidance to grant-making organizations on technical issues, as well as on legal issues related to the provision of public access to sound recordings preserved by grant funds" (73).
