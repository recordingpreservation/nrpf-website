## Call for Proposals

NRPF is pleased to invite proposals for its preservation grants program.
Through this funding program, we invite eligible non-profit libraries, archives, and other collecting organizations to plan and propose work that will preserve and stabilize significant audio collections under their stewardship.

Individual grants will be awarded up to $20,000 each. The following projects are eligible:

## Funding Guidelines

NRPF's 2025 preservation grants program may be used to support eligible preservation activities, including:
inventory and cataloging, collection condition appraisal, rehousing and stabilization based on best-practice preservation actions, preservation through digitization, and the creation of means for public and or research access to collections.

## Areas of Emphasis

We particularly encourage projects that address collections featuring these genres:

* broadcast
* spoken word
* folk and traditional music

Awards will be made solely on the merits of the work proposed and its responsiveness to this call for proposals.

## Deadline

July 15, 2025

## Who can Apply?


---
The National Recording Preservation Foundation offers grants to non-profit archives, libraries, museums, universities and other entities engaged in the preservation of audio materials that demonstrate cultural or historical importance and are held within the United States of America. In rare cases we may offer grants to commercial entities if a case can be made for the materialâ€™s cultural and historical value, the commercial holder cannot fund such preservation itself and a partnership exists with a non-profit entity in the field. Projects leading only to commercial release without an archival preservation component element will most likely be found lacking. The NRPF does not offer grants to individuals unless the materials are housed within a non-profit structure.

## Expected Awards

NRPF expects to make two to four awards in the amounts of between $5,000 and $10,000.

Awards will be announced on or around October 15, 2025.
