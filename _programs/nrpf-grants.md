In pursuing its mandate to preserve recorded sound heritage, the Foundation
awards grants to digitally preserve audio collections
that are stored on at-risk or obsolete physical media.
Since 2016, the Foundation has distributed over a quarter of a million dollars
to promote and preserve recorded sound history.
