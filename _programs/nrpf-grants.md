In pursuing its mandate to preserve recorded sound heritage, the Foundation
awards grants to digitally preserve audio collections
that are stored on at-risk or obsolete physical media.
Since 2016, the Foundation has distributed over a quarter of a million dollars
to promote and preserve recorded sound history.

At present, the Foundation does not have an open call for proposals.
Please watch our press releases for annnouncements of any pending NRPF grant opportunities.
