teaser: "Without action and dedicated resources, unique and irreplaceable audio heritage may be lost. We gather data and reports to inform audio preservation."

We aim to create data and provide background information to inform decision makers and collection stewards. 
This material informs audio preservation work from collection management to 
selection for digitization, from collection care and preservation to 
access and awareness.

As an organization dedicated to the coordination of resources that support 
awareness of recorded sound history and its preservation, we aim to provide
data that informs policies, decisions, and priorities 
for the work of preserving and creating access to audio recordings. 

In 2018, we supported critical work to survey the extent of recordings and preservation
needs in the broadcast archives of Historically Black Colleges and University
radio stations. 
As project director Jocelyn Robinson stated, "we won’t know what needs preservation until we survey the content and conditions of the radio archives on HBCU campuses. What we discover could have enormous potential for podcasts, radio and film documentaries, and museum exhibitions, allowing students, researchers, media producers, and communities to remember, honor and be inspired by the voices of this important legacy."
