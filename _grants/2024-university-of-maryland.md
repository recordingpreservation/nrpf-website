The Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) at the University of Maryland was funded to migrate and redevelop the Sound Collections Database, a critical resource for searching and identifying unique audio collections across the United States.

The Sound Collections Database (SCD), originally created by the Radio Preservation Task Force around 2012, inventories sound recording collections nationwide. By 2024, however, the database required urgent attention to remain viable, including technical redesign of the data structure and migration to new digital platforms.

The Sound Collections Database remains online, with support from NRPF, and is accessible at <https://database.radiopreservation.org/>.
