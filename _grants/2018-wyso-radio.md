“Nearly a third of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) have radio stations,”
says Jocelyn Robinson, project director, “and many went on the air during the Civil Rights era,
fifty or more years ago. Much of the material created at these stations during the struggle for
equality and beyond is now at risk, as magnetic tape and other obsolete formats deteriorate.
But we won’t know what needs preservation until we survey the content and conditions of the
radio archives on HBCU campuses. What we discover could have enormous potential for
podcasts, radio and film documentaries, and museum exhibitions, allowing students,
researchers, media producers, and communities to remember, honor and be inspired by the
voices of this important legacy.”
Thirty radio stations in thirteen states and the District of Columbia have been identified. The
report will be accessible to the radio stations, the various campus communities involved, and
to all students, faculty, scholars, researchers, and media producers wishing to access these
important and as yet untapped resources.
