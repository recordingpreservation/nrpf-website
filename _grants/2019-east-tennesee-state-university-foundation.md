Bluegrass, old-time, traditional Appalachian music – from 1961 all the way up to 1989 East
Tennessee State University recorded yearly festivals of vernacular music. Ralph Stanley &
the Clinch Mountain Boys, Bill Monroe, The Carter Family, Johnny Cash, Flatt & Scruggs,
Doc Watson, Del McCoury, J.D. Crowe, Clarence Tom Ashley, the Osborne Brothers – and
dozens more performing for home audiences at their artistic peaks.
The grant will help fund the restoration and digitization of over 800 analog recordings and
2,000 hours of audio of vernacular music festivals and field recordings, which feature
bluegrass, old-time, and traditional Appalachian music. Many of these recordings are the only
known copies to exist, containing unique performances and verbal contextualization that
provide irreplaceable information on local performance practices. Once completed the Archive
will work to provide public access to this material, thereby offering musicians and cultural
historians from across the nation new opportunities for performance and research.
