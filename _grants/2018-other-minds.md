Other Minds in San Francisco will digitize, catalog, and preserve a collection of DAT tapes dating from 1988&ndash;1991 documenting various conversations, lectures, interviews, and performances presented at the _Composer to Composer_ Festival in Telluride, Colorado.
“The collection comprises approximately 120 hours of recordings as well as numerous
ephemeral items related to the festival,” says Charles Amirkhanian, Executive & Artistic
Director of Other Minds. “During those four years, the festival hosted numerous emerging and
illustrious composers including John Cage, Lou Harrison, Joan La Barbara, Laurie Anderson, Anthony Davis, Terry Riley, Conlon Nancarrow, Pauline Oliveros, and many more.” Their
extensive interviews will be preserved for future generations.
