Between 1966 and 1968, Georgia State University students spread out to interview common
folk: men, women, and children in Georgia and across the southeast on topics including
crafts, storytelling, superstitions, jokes, remedies, songs and ballads, and local traditions. The
interviews provide unique insight into Southern Appalachian culture during the twentieth
century and will contribute to the teaching, study, and presentation of Southern Folklore.
The AHC will continue to partner with Preserve South for this project, a local audio and video
engineering firm that specializes in media migration. Upon grant completion, the content will
be freely open to the public.
