The Museum of Russian Culture holds a rare and vulnerable collection of early recordings
from folk balalaika orchestras to early Soviet dance music, Tsarist-era operatic divas to field
recordings of Russian refugees in China. A wide variety of these historical audio documents
will be digitized for the first time.
“The museum is very grateful to the NRPF for supporting the preservation and digitization of
our collection of Russian musical recordings,” says Yves Franquien, Vice President of the
Museum of Russian Culture, San Francisco. “Our archive contains a wide stylistic variety of
Russian music produced all over the world, from Moscow to Shanghai, New York to Paris.
This is a wonderful opportunity for us to digitize the rarest recordings, make them available
online, and integrate them into the main exhibition of our museum.”
“The recordings to be digitized include pre-revolutionary operatic arias produced under Tsar
Nicholas II and exceedingly rare Chinese pressings of Russian music marketed to imperial
loyalists following the Russian Civil War,” adds Ryan Gourley, Project Manager and Ph.D.
student in Ethnomusicology at UC Berkeley. “These are extraordinary objects of immense cultural heritage, some of which have not been listened to for over a century.”
“As part of the Russian Center of San Francisco, the largest hub for Russian cultural activity
in the American Pacific Northwest,” says Margarita Meniailenko, Chief Archivist, “the museum
is dedicated to peaceful intercultural exchange. We look forward to collaborating with
researchers in the United States and abroad on this unique project.”
