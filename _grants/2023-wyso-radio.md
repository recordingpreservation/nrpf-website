The HBCU Radio Preservation Project, in collaboration with WYSO/Miami Valley Public Media and the Northeast Document Conservation Center, will work to preserve archival radio materials from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), specifically those held at WRVS and the G. R. Little Library at Elizabeth City State University. The project will pilot a methodology that will serve as a model for working with and preserving other HCBU broadcasts surveyed during the project's previous round of NRPF funding.
