The HBCU Radio Preservation Project, in collaboration with WYSO Radio of Miami Valley Public Media, will work to survey civil rights-related radio broadcasts, specifically those held at WRVS and the G. R. Little Library at Elizabeth City State University. This will pilot a methodology that will serve as a model for working with and surveying other HCBU broadcasts discovered during the project's previous round of NRPF funding.
