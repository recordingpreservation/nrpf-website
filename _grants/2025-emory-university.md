The Pitts Theology Library at Emory University will complete the digitization of audio recordings in the Howard Thurman Collection. The project will preserve up to 160 audiocassette recordings featuring the voice of Howard Thurman (1899–1981), the influential Baptist minister, theologian, philosopher, author, educator, and civil rights leader whose teachings on nonviolence profoundly influenced Martin Luther King, Jr. Named one of America’s 12 greatest preachers by Life magazine in 1953, Thurman authored over 20 books and hundreds of articles throughout his remarkable career. These recordings, recently donated to the library, capture sermons, lectures, and meditations spanning from 1952 to 1981. The project will digitize approximately 160 hours of irreplaceable audio recordings.
