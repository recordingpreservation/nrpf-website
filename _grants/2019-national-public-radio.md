“Voices in the Wind established NPR’s reputation as the leading curator of the arts,” says Bill
Siemering, NPR’s founding Programming Director and a former contributor to Voices in the
Wind. “There was no other place in broadcasting where listeners could hear the voices of so
many writers and other artists during this period.”
In 255 episodes and over 2100 story segments, host Oscar Brand interviewed such
luminaries as James Baldwin, Merle Haggard, Alice Walker, John Lennon, Aaron Copland,
Gamble Rogers, Henry Fonda, Ansel Adams, Pete Seeger, Letta Mbulu, Margaret Atwood,
Marlene Dietrich, Alvin Ailey, Elia Kazan, Patti Smith, David Mamet, Claudette Colbert, Fred
Rogers, Dolly Parton, Edward Gorey, Nikki Giovanni, Itzhak Perlman, Marian Anderson, Shel
Silverstein and Lucille Clifton. That is anyone’s idea of diversity and range.
