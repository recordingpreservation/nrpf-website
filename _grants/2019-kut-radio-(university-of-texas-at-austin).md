Says Laura Willis, Digital Assets and Operations Coordinator, “Digitizing these reels in order
to make them available online will provide a wealth of exciting, wide-ranging local and global
research material.” The material covers a wide range of public figures including Stokely
Carmichael, Dick Gregory, Joseph Heller, Walt Rostow, Dr. Page Keeton, Walter Cronkite,
Ruth Bader Ginsberg, Bill Moyers, Coretta Scott King and Barbara Jordan. The digitized
broadcasts are given wide public access through a collaboration with the American Archive of
Public Broadcasting, which will stream the programs online.
