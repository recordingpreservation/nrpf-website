Peabody Award-winning Afropop Worldwide had been bringing the music and artists of Africa
and its diaspora to over 100 US radio stations since 1988. Hosted by Cameroonian Georges
Collinet, the series is distributed by Public Radio International. The grant will help fund the
preservation of field recordings and interviews with the seminal artists of these regions that
were made over a period of 20 years. Audio includes many artists who created styles that
have now traveled the world. "We were lucky to travel in Africa and the Caribbean at a time
when legends like Franco, Tabu Ley, Mahlathini and the Mahotella Queens and so many
others were still on the scene,” says Sean Barlow, CEO. “Our interviews and informal
recordings are a time capsule to the golden age of African pop, and we are so pleased that
these recordings are now being preserved and catalogued for future fans and researchers."
