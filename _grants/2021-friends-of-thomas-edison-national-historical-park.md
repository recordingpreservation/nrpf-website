"We are gratified to receive this Grant for Audio Preservation from the National Recording
Preservation Foundation,” says Larry Fast, Trustee, The Friends of Thomas Edison National
Historical Park. “The money will fund research to determine best practices for digitizing
Thomas Edison National Historical Park's priceless collection of disc record ‘Master Molds.’
These metal molds contain the master recordings from inventor Thomas Edison's catalog of
music recorded in New York City and European cities during the 1910s and 1920s. The molds
are too fragile to digitize via the traditional stylus-playback method, so we will digitize a pair of
molds using the Northeast Document Conservation Center's "IRENE" system. IRENE (an acronym for Image, Reconstruct, Erase Noise, Etc.) uses a
non-contact 3-D scanner to recover audio from phonograph records. This is exciting research
because an Edison Master Mold has never been digitized using IRENE."
