"The ‘Cuttlefish Project’ recordings are of immense Unangax̂ (Alaska Aleut) cultural
importance due to not only the topics covered by Elders but because many of them were the
last fluent speakers of the Unangam Tunuu language,” says Leslie McCartney, Associate
Professor and Curator of Oral History at the Elmer E. Rasmuson Library. “They are of the
utmost importance to the Unangax̂ people themselves, for educators around the world who
study the diversity of Indigenous people in the United States, and for worldwide linguists and
historians.”
Fifty-nine open-reel audiotapes of the "Cuttlefish Project" will be digitized and made accessible to
researchers and the public. Each of the recordings will be cataloged in the UAF Library
Catalog via WordCat. URLs will be placed directly into the library catalog record so anyone around the world with an internet connection may find and listen to the recording.
