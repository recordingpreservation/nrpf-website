The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute (WHOI) Library will digitize, digitally preserve, and make accessible more than 200 rare audograph disc recordings dating from 1949 and later. These underwater recordings, captured by the Gray Audograph, a now-rare, reusable sound recorder, include some of the earliest examples of recorded marine wildlifeâ€”predating previously known recordings by several years. Beyond their significance to recorded sound history, these recordings hold immense scientific value as early audio documentation of marine biodiversity from an era when few to no other underwater recordings exist. The project will preserve up to 200 hours of this at-risk archival audio collection.
