"With support from the National Recording Preservation Foundation, the American Folk Art
Museum will digitize rare audio recordings of interviews with folk artists that were recorded by Charles B. and Janice M. Rosenak throughout their travels in the Southeast, Appalachia, and
New Mexico from 1967-1988,” says Jason Busch, Director and CEO of the American Folk Art
Museum (AFAM). “These unique recordings capture the voices of some of the most prominent selftaught
artists of the 20th century, primarily African American and Native American artists, that
have been widely absent from the canon of American art."

The interviews come from _In Their Own Words: Digitizing the Hidden Recordings of Folk
Artists' Interviews from the Rosenak Collection in the American Folk Art Museum Archives_.

"The project will enable a wider audience to access recordings of interviews with 26 iconic
self-taught artists including Howard Finster, Sam Doyle, William Dawson, Lee Goodie, Malcah
Zeldis, Leroy Felipe Archuleta, and others, all of whom are no longer living today," says Ann-Marie Reilly, Director of Collections and Exhibition Production. “As AFAM prepares to mark its
sixtieth anniversary in 2021, the project will be part of a broader celebration of our collection as we mark six decades of leadership in the field of self-taught art.”
