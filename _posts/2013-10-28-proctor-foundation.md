The Mattina R. Proctor Foundation has awarded the National Recording Preservation Foundation a $5,000 grant for the preservation of culturally-significant recordings from Maine, with a special emphasis on the mid-coastal region.

Mattina R. Proctor (1926-2005) was a compassionate philanthropist from Camden, Maine and Boston, who championed and funded many worthwhile projects to benefit the poor and ill, protect the environment and bring fine music and arts to the people.

The NRPF is preparing the call for proposals for Maine-focused audio preservation projects in the near future. Subscribe to our mailing list to be alerted or to receive periodic information on our efforts.
