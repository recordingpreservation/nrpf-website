We are excited to launch our new podcast, _Sound Files_!
NRPF's _Sound Files_ will feature conversations with audio archivists,
highlight the audio preservation projects that NRPF has supported,
and share insights on the current state of audio preservation.

Episodes feature long-form conversations with audio archivists, 
sounds from the collections we have supported through [NRPF grants]({% link _programs/nrpf-grants.md %}),
interviews with voices from the audio preservation community,
and occasional updates on our activities and programs.

The podcast is hosted by [Jesse Johnston]({% link _team/jesse-johnston.md %}), NRPF Executive Director and
Clinical Assistant Professor at the [University of Michigan School of Information](https://si.umich.edu/),
and [Evan Haywood]({% link _team/evan-haywood.md %}), audio preservationist and podcast producer for NRPF. 
In addition, we are thrilled that each episode will feature original music
by Evan and cover art by [umbertino](https://99designs.com/profiles/774966).

We look forward to bringing you on this journey with us!
Our trailer episode is now live, and you can listen from this site or on
your favorite podcast platforms. Find out more about the podcast and links to the trailer on the [podcast page]({% link _programs/nrpf-podcast.md %}).
