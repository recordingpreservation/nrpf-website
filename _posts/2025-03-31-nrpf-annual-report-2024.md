I am excited to release the Foundation's Annual Report for 2023 and 2024. As those of you who follow NRPF already know, we have gone through a period of transition and renewal over the past few years, and this report discusses some of the Foundation's changes and strategies going forward. I am excited to introduce this and look forward to sharing more news as we continue our mission to promote and preserve unique, at-risk audio collections that are significant to America's history!

The National Recording Preservation Foundation (NRPF) _promotes_ and _preserves_ America’s audio heritage—by raising funds and distributing grants to archives, libraries, museums and other non-profit collecting organizations. In 2023 and 2024, the Foundation undertook a strategic re-start and planning, revamped its communications, and supported significant American audio archives through critical preservation grants.

The Foundation receives support from the private sector, academia, and a range of performers and public figures who value NRPF’s continued work to safeguard America’s rich audio history.

> Every sound tells a story, and with your help, we can ensure they endure.

## Funding Impact

Looking ahead to 2025, NRPF will focus on three strategic priorities:

2. **Supporting Education and Training:** Investing in training and education for current and future audio preservation professionals
3. **Raising Awareness:** Continuing the Sound Files podcast and developing public programming to highlight the importance of audio preservation
