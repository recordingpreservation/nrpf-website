_Below read our letter to supporters on GivingTuesday 2024:_

Dear Sound Preservation Supporter,

America's audio heritage is at risk. Rare recordings – from jazz pioneers to civil rights speeches – on physical media are deteriorating, with thousands of historical sounds at risk of being lost forever.

The National Recording Preservation Foundation advances the Library of Congress's mission to save these unique and irreplaceable audio treasures. This Giving Tuesday, consider a donation! Support increases our funding for grants, which can:

* Rescue deteriorating recordings
* Support digitization of at-risk audio collections
* Amplify trainings for community-based sound preservation capacity
* Raise awareness about the risks of audio degradation

Every gift ensures that the voices of our past continue to speak to future generations. Donate today and be a guardian of sound history!
