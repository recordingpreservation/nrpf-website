## Description

Audio preservation projects often require additional investments when organizations undertake them, particularly due to the many specialized technical, equipment, and storage needs. Likewise, many collections face diminishing budgets, and external funding is often required to support special projects. In this situation, many collections managers are interested in pursuing external grants, but  archivists, librarians, researchers, and collections managers often have little, if any, training and education on successfully applying for grants. This webinar will offer insights on current organizational grant opportunities that can be opportunities to support or plan audio preservation projects. Representatives of current funders - including the Council for Library and Information Resources, Institute for Museum and Library Services, National Endowment for the Humanities, and the National Recording Preservation Foundation - will provide overviews of their grant offerings relevant to audio preservation and examples of projects that may be eligible for funding. Funder representatives will include Erin Barsan (IMLS), Sharon Burney (CLIR), and Joshua Sternfeld (NEH). Theyâ€™ll also provide tips on writing successful applications. Jesse Johnston (University of Michigan School of Information and National Recording Preservation Foundation) and Allison Schein (Radio Preservation Task Force), successful grant writers themselves, will moderate the discussion. The webinar will close with a question-and-answer session where attendees can ask the program officers for further guidance in the complex and often confusing process of applying for grants.

## Resources

The webinar will be held via Zoom videoconference on April 5, 2024. We will post transcript and edited recordings here following the webinar.
