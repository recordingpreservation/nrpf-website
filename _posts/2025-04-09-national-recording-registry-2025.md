## The 2025 National Recording Registry

Today, Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden named 25 audio recordings to be desiganted as treasures
worthy of preservation for all time based on their cultural, historical, or aesthetic
importance to the nation’s heritage.

The 2025 registry features a wide range of genres and styles that span the breadth of America's recorded sound heritage. Elton John's monumental album “Goodbye Yellow Brick Road,” Chicago’s debut
“Chicago Transit Authority,” the original cast recording of Broadway’s “Hamilton,” Mary
J. Blige’s “My Life,” Amy Winehouse’s “Back to Black,” Brian Eno's reboot chime for Microsoft Windows, and
the soundtrack to the Minecraft video game phenomenon have been selected as some
of the defining sounds of history and culture that will join the National Recording
Registry of the Library of Congress.

In her announement, Hayden noted, “These are the sounds of America &ndash; our wide-ranging history and culture. The National Recording Registry is our evolving nation’s playlist.”

For [National Public Radio](https://www.npr.org/)'s _Morning Edition_ today, [Neda Ulaby](https://www.npr.org/people/3850482/neda-ulaby) [noted](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/09/nx-s1-5352774/national-recording-registry-tracy-chapman-elton-john-hamilton-minecraft) the earliest and most recent additions:

> "The oldest recording on this year's list is from 1913. "Aloha 'Oe" was composed by Princess Lili'uokalani (who later became Queen of Hawai'i). The song had been beloved in Hawai'i for decades before being set to wax by the Hawaiian Quintette.
> 
> The newest recording is 2015's Broadway cast album of Hamilton. Creator Lin-Manuel Miranda noted its inclusion coincides with the show's 10th anniversary."

## NRPF Impact

Since 2012, the National Recording Preservation Foundation (NRPF) has awarded over a quarter of a million in grants to support unique, at-risk audio collections held by non-profit audio archives, libraries, and other cultural heritage organizations. To learn more, check out [our NRPF preservation grants page]({% link _programs/nrpf-grants.md %}) and read our [2024 Annual Report]({% link _posts/2025-03-31-nrpf-annual-report-2024.md %}).

## The Urgency of Audio Preservation

The new inductees to the National Recording Registry remind us of the significance of preservation support for significant audio recordings. Imagine if any of these recordings were lost or no longer available! The Registry represents the pinnacle of American recordings, symbolizing the larger body of recordings held by audio archives and collections stewarded by the recording industry, libraries and archives, and individuals. All analog sound recording formats are at high risk of loss due to the degradation of physical media and the increasing difficulty of finding or maintaining playback equipment.

The NRPF's mission is to raise awareness about the significance of these recordings, assist in gathering resources to preserve them, and to support at-risk audio recordings in the many more collections that do not make it to the national registry. One way we can increase our impact is through private donations, which we gather together and return to audio archives and other non-profit collecting organizations through preservation grants.

## Donate

A donation to the National Recording Preservation Foundation supports the work of non-profit audio archives, libraries, and other cultural organizations, to secure the longterm availability of at-risk audio heritage. Donations can be made directly at [https://secure.givelively.org/donate/national-recording-preservation-foundation/](https://secure.givelively.org/donate/national-recording-preservation-foundation/).

## About the National Recording Registry

Under the terms of the National Recording Preservation Act of 2000, the Librarian of
Congress, with advice from the National Recording Preservation Board, selects 25 titles
each year that are "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" and are at least 10
years old. More information on the National Recording Registry can be found
at [the web page of the National Recording Preservation Board](https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-recording-preservation-board/about-this-program/). The
public may nominate recordings for the Board's consideration [here](https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-recording-preservation-board/recording-registry/nominate/).

Some registry titles have already been preserved by the copyright holders, artists or
other archives. In cases where a selected title has not already been preserved, the
Library of Congress National Audio-Visual Conservation Center works to ensure that the
recording will be preserved by some entity and available for future generations. This can
be through the Library’s recorded-sound preservation program or through collaborative
ventures with other archives, studios and independent producers.
