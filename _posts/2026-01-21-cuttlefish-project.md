How are languages on the brink of extinction preserved? This episode follows the preservation journey of The Cuttlefish Project, an initiative dedicated to revitalizing the Unangam Tunuu language through a treasure trove of archival recordings. You'll hear how these once-overlooked tapes were brought back to life, thanks to the efforts of educator George Pletnikoff Junior and curator Leslie McCartney, who worked tirelessly to digitize them and make them accessible to a global audience.

We'll also take a look at the past, and the rich cultural significance these recordings hold for the Unangax̂ community and the challenges they face in keeping their language alive. From the heartfelt stories behind the tapes to the complex historical backdrop that led to the decline of fluent speakers, this episode emphasizes the importance of audio archives in cultural identity. However, the path to revitalization is not without its hurdles. With fewer than 200 fluent speakers remaining today, George and his community are grappling with the unique challenges of engaging new generations while honoring their linguistic roots.

The digitized tapes from the Cuttlefish Project can be found and streamed in full from the University of Alaska.
