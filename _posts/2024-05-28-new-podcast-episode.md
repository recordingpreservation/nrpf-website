The next episode of the _Sound Files_ podcast is out!
This episode features a conversation with Jocelyn Robinson,
who is working on a project to preserve radio broadcast archives at Historically Black Colleges and Universities.
During the conversation, she shares some of the history of these radio stations and their importance to campus life, and her ongoing work to gather resources to survey and preserve the archives of about 30 stations throughout the southeast. Robinson is project director of the HBCU Radio Preservation Project,
which has twice received support from the NRPF: first in [2018]({% link _grants/2018-wyso-radio.md %}) and most recently in [2023]({% link _grants/2023-wyso-radio.md %}).

Show hosts [Jesse Johnston]({% link _team/jesse-johnston.md %}) and [Evan Haywood]({% link _team/evan-haywood.md %}) talk with [Jocelyn Robinson](https://www.wyso.org/people/jocelyn-robinson) about the preservation of archives from HBCU radio stations. Robinson is Director of Radio Preservation and Archives at WYSO public radio and project director for the [HBCU Radio Preservation Project](https://www.wyso.org/hbcuradioproject), which is working to preserve radio broadcast archives at Historically Black Colleges and Universities. During the conversation, she shared about the history of these radio stations and their importance to campus life, and her ongoing work to gather resources to survey and preserve the archives of about 30 stations throughout the southeast. We also talked about the content and sound of the stations, which led us into thinking about why audio archives are so unique and important, as well as some tips on how to start out on an audio archiving project. During the interview, we were able to include a few sound clips from the WRVS station archives. These were sourced from and used courtesy of the Elizabeth City State University (North Carolina), Archives and Special Collections, G.R. Little Library.
