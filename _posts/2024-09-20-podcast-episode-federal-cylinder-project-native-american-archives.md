The next episode of the _Sound Files_ podcast is now available wherever you get your podcasts!
In this episode of Sound Files, hosts Jesse Johnston and Evan Haywood discuss the Federal Cylinder Project, a major audio preservation and community engagement project by the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress, with Judith Gray. They interview Judith, who discusses the projectâ€™s history, its mission to reconnect Native American communities with historic wax cylinder recordings, and the ethical considerations involved in making these materials accessible to their source communities.

The conversation discusses the history and origins of the Federal Cylinder Project and ongoing efforts to build relationships between steward institutions like the Library of Congress and Native American communities. They also discuss some of the ethical considerations in preserving and returning audio archives. Finally, they discussed the significance of why preserving audio archives like this is culturally important work. Throughout the conversation are interspersed examples and clips from the Library's extensive recordings, including a Hethushka song from an Omaha powwow in 1983, a 1925 recording of Louis Pigeon singing a Menominee legend recorded by Frances LaFlesche, and an example of the oldest known ethnographic field recordings of the Passamaquoddy Tribe in Calais, Maine, recorded in 1890.
