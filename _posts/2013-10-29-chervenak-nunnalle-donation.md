We are delighted to announce that the Chervenak-Nunnallé Foundation has donated $10,000 to the National Recording Preservation Foundation.

The New York City-based Chervenak-Nunnallé Foundation is committed to supporting the arts and sciences, especially through youth scholarships, and regularly contributes to community programs. Their generous gift will help further the NRPF’s mission to fund the preservation of important American recordings including music, radio broadcasts, oral histories and spoken word.
