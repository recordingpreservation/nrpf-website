The National Recording Preservation Foundation congratulates
the artists, songwriters, and composers of the Class of 2024 Inductees
to the [National Recording Registry]({{ site.data.nrpf_data.natrecregistry_link }}).
Each year, the Librarian of Congress selects twenty-five sound recordings,
chosen from a slate of public nominations, which represent audio treasures
worthy of preservation in perpetuity based on their cultural, historical or aesthetic
importance to the nation’s recorded sound heritage.

The latest selections named to the registry span from 1919 to 1998. They range from
the recordings of the all-Black 369th U.S. Infantry Band led by James Reese Europe
after World War I, to defining sounds of jazz and bluegrass, and iconic recordings from
pop, dance, country, rock, rap, Latin and classical music.
Highlights of the 2024 inductees include ABBA’s “Dancing Queen,”
Blondie’s era-defining “Parallel Lines,” The Notorious B.I.G.’s
landmark “Ready to Die,” Green Day’s “Dookie,” The Chicks’ “Wide Open Spaces” and
Lily Tomlin’s comedy.
The recordings selected for addition to the National Recording Registry in 2024
bring the number of titles on the registry to 650,
representing a small portion of the national library’s vast recorded
sound collection of nearly 4 million items.

adding to the registry. The public can submit nominations throughout the year on the
Library's web site. Nominations for next year will be accepted until Oct. 1, 2024. The
