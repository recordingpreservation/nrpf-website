# NRPF Board and Advisors

The Board of Directors provides oversight of the Foundation's resources and programs.
Directors are appointed by the Librarian of Congress and represent diverse points of view from the sound recording community.
Board members are selected for their
knowledge of philanthropy and grantmaking, as well
as experience in sound recording production,
distribution, preservation, or restoration.
While the Board of Directors oversees NRPF's governance, budget, and strategy,
the Secretary serves as the Executive Director and manages day-to-day operations.
