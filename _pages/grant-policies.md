## Indirect Cost Policy

The National Recording Preservation Foundation does not pay indirect costs.
Indirect cost recovery agreements are the result of negotiations
between federal funding agencies and universities, or other research institutions,
that carry out government-sponsored research.

The National Recording Preservation Foundation is not a federal funding agency
and does not support "sponsored research."
It is our policy to fund direct costs only.
