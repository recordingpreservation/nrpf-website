## Indirect Cost Policy

The National Recording Preservation Foundation does not pay indirect costs.
Indirect cost recovery agreements are negotiated
between federal funding agencies and universities, or other research institutions,
that carry out government-sponsored research.

The National Recording Preservation Foundation is not a federal funding agency
and does not support "sponsored research."
It is our policy to fund direct costs only.

## Reporting

All recipients of NRPF funds are required to submit reports on their activities. These reports are used by NRPF to assess the impact of its resources, and to create impact stories.
The Foundation will provide funded projects with information about how and when to report on their projects.
