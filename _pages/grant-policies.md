## Indirect Cost Policy

The National Recording Preservation Foundation does not pay indirect costs.
Indirect cost recovery agreements are negotiated
between federal funding agencies and universities, or other research institutions,
that carry out government-sponsored research.

The National Recording Preservation Foundation is not a federal funding agency
and does not support "sponsored research."
It is our policy to fund direct costs only.

## Reporting

All recipients of NRPF funds are required to submit reports to NRPF regarding their NRPF-funded activities.
These reports are used by NRPF to track the outcomes of funded projects,
assess the impact of NRPF resources,
and may also be used to communicate with the public regarding the outcomes and impacts of NRPF's work.
The Foundation will provide funded projects with information about how and when to report on NRPF-funded projects.
