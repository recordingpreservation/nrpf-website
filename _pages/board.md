# NRPF Board and Staff

Our board of directors provides oversight for NRPF activities.
Directors are appointed by the Librarian of Congress and represent diverse points of view from the sound recording community.
Board members are selected for their
knowledge of philanthropy and grantmaking, as well
as experience in sound recording production,
distribution, preservation, or restoration.
Board members oversee NRPF programs, strategy, budget, and governance.
